      "Dear Hari,\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for sharing your concerns about frequent headaches over the past few months. After careful consideration of your symptoms and medical history, our team has reached a conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the available information, it is likely that you are experiencing Migraines. This diagnosis is supported by the fact that your headaches have been ongoing for several months, which is a common characteristic of migraines.\n",
      "\n",
      "We understand that this may not be a definitive diagnosis without further evaluation. However, our analysis suggests that migraines are a plausible explanation for your symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "To confirm this diagnosis and develop an effective treatment plan, we strongly recommend scheduling a physical examination with a healthcare professional. They will be able to assess you in person, review your medical history, and provide personalized guidance on managing your condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, consider trying over-the-counter NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) and resting in a dark room when you experience headaches. These self-care strategies may help alleviate some symptoms, but please keep in mind that they are not a replacement for professional medical attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. We're here to support you throughout this process.\n",

      "* Consider trying NSAIDs and resting in a dark room when experiencing headaches.\n",

      "Stay positive, Hari! With the right guidance and care, we can work together to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.\n",
